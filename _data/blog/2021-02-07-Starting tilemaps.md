# Creating Tilempas

Today I didn't do much, I just started creating the tilemaps for my gare. This is the first time I try to make tilemaps by my self, by just taking reference from other people to follow a "style" and hope that they are decent.

I started with the dungeon tiles because this game is going to have duungeons where you will fight enemies and faster that I tried to make some grass for the overworld of the game. To know how to make the tilemaps I followed some tutorials that i found andd... there is nothing else to say, I haven't finished the basic tilemaps, maybe I will finish them tomorrow and hopefully I can start working with the core mechanics of the game.
